# An artificial intelligence framework for development of novel selective kinase inhibitors
## Overview
This project brings together artificial intelligence and drug discovery to develop novel and selective kinase inhibitors. Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in signalling pathways within cells, and kinase inhibitors have shown potential for treating diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. However, the issue of target selectivity has been a significant challenge in the development of novel therapeutic agents.

This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence framework that will design kinase inhibitors with high target selectivity and prioritise those with the potential to be effective. By exploring molecular features that engender selectivity in kinase inhibition, the framework will be able to produce compounds that have the inherent characteristics of target-selective inhibitors.

This transformative research has the potential to revolutionise pharmaceutical discovery, opening up new possibilities for drug development. Additionally, the project will contribute to the development of high-value industries in New Zealand, such as the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors, thereby diversifying the economy and linking it to international expertise and markets.

The proposed approach to drug discovery is also environmentally friendly, contributing to the transition to a low-emission economy. By reducing the use of energy-intensive experiments and environmentally harmful chemicals, the method enhances the efficiency of drug discovery while contributing to environmental sustainability.
